			Most of my web development energy at the moment is goin towards a professional website for use in job searches and internship opportunities,<br>
			but I hope I can make this website experience engaging for you. Since my good website is not yet properly hosted, the most interesting link I can <br>
      			offer you in this trying time is the one to my <a href="https://myceilingistilted.itch.io/periphery">itch.io</a> page, where the incomplete beta of my Powered by the Apocalypse table top game Periphery is hosted. <br><br>
			<strong>
				Or you could be boring and just head <a href="https://github.com/kmluce-eths23/kmluce-eths23.github.io">back to my repo</a>.
